1. This file contains frailty indices for a total of 3090 participants in Arivale. Three sets of frailty indices were derived, self-report frailty index, laboratory frailty index, and the combo-frailty index (combination of the previous two). The list of items for frailty index calculation was originally derived from Blodgett et al., 2017 and modified due to absence of several items. 

2. Self-report frailty index, 35 items. There are 15 items for the disease category, 6 items for satisfaction category, 9 items for activity category, 3 items for medication category and 2 items for digestion category. 

3. Laboratory frailty index, 35 items. There are 30 items for chemical/test category and 5 items for blood pressures. 

4. For each item, we follow one of the following scoring system: 
    - a normal range was derived from Arivale dataset (different vendors were taken into consideration) 
    - categorical variables will be assigned a number within 0 to 1, based on the number of levels. 
      For instance, a 5 level items will be assigned 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 according to the nature of the item
    - For each disease item, if any one of the disease in the category present, the score will be 1 for the category. 

5. Frailty index was defined as the overall score divided by the number of available items.

6. Definition for the items. Please see Google sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oMdaFsTxLUviiUlrfQ9alRHg9_BuXB4Qdrd_LvUfOHc/edit#gid=0\
